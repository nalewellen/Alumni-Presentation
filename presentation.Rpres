Background
========================================================
type:exclaim

## Education

- B.A. Economics, University of Tulsa, 2013
- M.A. Economics, Duke University, 2015
- M.S. Analytics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Present

## Work

- Financial Analyst, CFO Network, 2016-17
- Quantitative Risk Modeler, Bank of the Ozarks, 2017-18
- Senior Credit Data Analytics Officer, Bank of the Ozarks, 2018-present

Graduate Education
========================================================

## Why?

- If you ask "Why should I go to graduate school" and the answer
mentions the job market, start over. 

## Where?

- Better schools are preferred. 
    - If Master's, then name brand.
    - If PhD, experience and environment.
- Go somewhere you'll be happy. 
- Consider online or distance programs. 
    - Often cheaper
    - Allow you to work 
    - Excellent Universities (Hopkins, GA Tech, Penn State)

 

Graduate Education pt. 2
========================================================

## When?

- There is no good answer for this. 
- Right after college or a few years after can both work.

<b>Don't take advice on graduate school (or anything else) too seriously!</b>
<br>
- Advice is always based on personal experience. My experience is not your experience.

- You have your own tastes and preferences, and you know them better than I do. 

- It's really hard to make a life ruining decision right after college. 

My Experience at Duke
========================================================
<br>
- Math
- Most econ programs are very structured.
- Augment your education to your interests and needs. 
- It's going to be hard. 


Job Opportunities in Banking
========================================================

## Data and Statisitics 

- Commercial banking as perfect competition
- The analytics revolution in commercial banking
- Economists are suited to the task


## Dodd-Frank Act

- The Dodd Frank Act Stress Testing (i.e., DFAST) created an even greater need for 
economists, data scientists and analytics experts in banking.
- Despite what you hear, the industry has seemed to welcome the influx of talent.
- Even if DFAST is repealed, Stress Testing and economic analysis still has a place in
banking.

Stress Test Case Study
========================================================

- If the economy enters a recession, what happens to the 
bank's assets, deposits, etc.?
- The goal is to produce financial statements and projects
based on three scenarios: baseline, adverse, severely adverse.
- Example: Single Family Residential balances

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("Final Balances.csv")%>%
    select(file_date, BAL_1c)%>%
    mutate(`SFR Loan` = BAL_1c, `SFR Loan Growth Rate` = (diff(BAL_1c)/lag(BAL_1c)),
           Date = as.Date(file_date))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.extra='angle=90', fig.height = 8, fig.width = 12}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = `SFR Loan`))+
    geom_line(color = "Blue", size = 1)+
    scale_y_continuous(name = "Single Family Residential Loan Balance (1,000)", labels = scales::dollar)+
    scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", date_breaks = "12 months",
                 expand = c(0,0))+ 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust = 0.5))+
    theme_minimal()+
    ggtitle("Bank of the Ozarks Total Single Family Residential Loan Balance")
```

Stress Test Case Study pt. 2
========================================================

- Initial questions:
    - What happened during other recessions?
    - What factors contributed to the bank's growth and 
    contraction? 

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("Final Balances.csv")%>%
    select(file_date, BAL_1c)%>%
    mutate(`SFR Loan` = BAL_1c, `SFR Loan Growth Rate` = (diff(BAL_1c)/lag(BAL_1c)),
           Date = as.Date(file_date))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.extra='angle=90', fig.height = 8, fig.width = 12}
dates <- c("2003-06-30",
            "2010-03-31",
            "2010-09-30",
            "2010-12-31",
            "2011-03-31",
            "2011-06-30",

            "2013-09-30",
            "2014-03-31",
            "2014-06-30",
            "2015-03-31",
            "2015-09-30",
            "2016-09-30")

dates <- as.Date(dates)

ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = `SFR Loan`))+
    geom_line(color = "Blue", size = 1)+
    geom_vline(xintercept=dates)+
    scale_y_continuous(name = "Single Family Residential Loan Balance (1,000)", labels = scales::dollar)+
    scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", date_breaks = "12 months",
                 expand = c(0,0))+ 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust = 0.5))+
    theme_minimal()+
    ggtitle("Bank of the Ozarks Total Single Family Residential Loan Balance")
```

Stress Test Case Study pt. 3
========================================================

- The DFAST problem is in changes. 
- BOTO grew from acquisitions. 

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("Final Balances.csv")%>%
    select(file_date, BAL_1c)%>%
    mutate(`SFR Loan` = BAL_1c, `SFR Loan Growth Rate` = (BAL_1c - lag(BAL_1c))/lag(BAL_1c, n = 1),
           Date = as.Date(file_date))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.extra='angle=90', fig.height = 8, fig.width = 12}
dates <- c("2003-06-30",
            "2010-03-31",
            "2010-09-30",
            "2010-12-31",
            "2011-03-31",
            "2011-06-30",
            "2012-12-31",
            "2013-09-30",
            "2014-03-31",
            "2014-06-30",
            "2015-03-31",
            "2015-09-30",
            "2016-09-30")

dates <- as.Date(dates)

ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = `SFR Loan Growth Rate`))+
    geom_line(color = "Blue", size = 1)+
    geom_vline(xintercept=dates)+
    scale_y_continuous(name = "Percent Growth of Single Family Residential Loan Balances", labels = scales::percent)+
    scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", date_breaks = "12 months",
                 expand = c(0,0))+ 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust = 0.5))+
    theme_minimal()+
    ggtitle("Bank of the Ozarks Total Single Family Residential Loan Balance")

```

- We have to control for acquisitions. 
- Macroeconomic variables to contorl for the relationship
between the bank and the macroeconomic environment.

- Include binary variables for acquisitions
