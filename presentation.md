Graduate Education pt. 2
========================================================

## When?

- There is no good answer for this. 
- Right after college or a few years after can both work.

<b>Don't take advice on graduate school (or anything else) too seriously!</b>
<br>
- Advice is always based on personal experience. My experience is not your experience.

- You have your own tastes and preferences, and you know them better than I do. 

- It's really hard to make a life ruining decision right after college. 

My Experience at Duke
========================================================
<br>
- Math
- Most econ programs are very structured.
- Augment your education to your interests and needs. 
- It's going to be hard. 


Job Opportunities in Banking
========================================================

## Data and Statisitics 

- Commercial banking as perfect competition
- The analytics revolution in commercial banking
- Economists are suited to the task


## Dodd-Frank Act

- The Dodd Frank Act Stress Testing (i.e., DFAST) created an even greater need for 
economists, data scientists and analytics experts in banking.
- Despite what you hear, the industry has seemed to welcome the influx of talent.
- Even if DFAST is repealed, Stress Testing and economic analysis still has a place in
banking.

Stress Test Case Study
========================================================

- If the economy enters a recession, what happens to the 
bank's assets, deposits, etc.?
- The goal is to produce financial statements and projects
based on three scenarios: baseline, adverse, severely adverse.
- Example: Single Family Residential balances

Stress Test Case Study pt. 2
========================================================

- Initial questions:
    - What happened during other recessions?
    - What factors contributed to the bank's growth and 
    contraction?

Stress Test Case Study pt. 3
========================================================

- The DFAST problem is in changes. 
- BOTO grew from acquisitions. 



<img src="presentation-figure/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" angle=90 style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

- We have to control for acquisitions. 
- Macroeconomic variables to contorl for the relationship
between the bank and the macroeconomic environment.
